# EmpathicCall-Enhancer

EmpathicCall-Enhancer is a machine learning-driven tool designed to improve customer service interactions. By analyzing the sentiment of customer calls in real-time, it predicts when a call needs escalation and generates empathetic responses tailored to the detected sentiment. This project aims to help customer service representatives (CSRs) respond more effectively, leading to enhanced customer satisfaction.




## Key Features

- Sentiment Analysis: Detects and analyzes customer emotions during calls in real-time.
- Escalation Prediction: Predicts when a call should be escalated to higher-level support.
- Empathetic Response Generation: Automatically generates responses that align with the detected sentiment to improve communication.

## Future Work
- Dataset Expansion: Enhance model accuracy by incorporating a larger, more diverse dataset.
- CRM Integration: Connect the tool with existing Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems.
- Multi-Language Support: Add support for analyzing calls in multiple languages to cater to a global audience.
